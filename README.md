Modern development involves several AI coding agents — OpenCode, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and more. Each stores its skills and slash commands in its own local directory. The result:

- The same prompt exists in five different places, each slightly out of sync
- A fix to a system prompt must be applied manually to every agent
- Nothing is versioned, so configuration is lost when you reformat or switch machines
- There is no way to share useful prompts with teammates or the community

`agent-manager` fixes this with a single git repo as the source of truth. Skills and commands live here. The tool creates symlinks into each agent's configuration directory so every agent picks them up. Update a file once — every agent sees the change.

## Prerequisites

- macOS 13 or later, or Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+)
- Swift 6.2 — only required when **building from source**; pre-compiled binaries need no toolchain
  - macOS: bundled with [Xcode 26+](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or the [Swift toolchain](https://www.swift.org/install/)
  - Linux: install via the [Swift toolchain](https://www.swift.org/install/)

---

## Installation

### Option A — one-liner (no clone required)

Downloads a pre-compiled binary and creates a ready-to-use repo at `~/.config/agent-manager/src`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molayab/swift-agent-manager/main/quickinstall.sh | bash
```

Install system-wide, pin to a version, or choose a custom directory:

```sh
# Install binary to /usr/local/bin as well
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molayab/swift-agent-manager/main/quickinstall.sh | bash -s -- --global

# Pin to a specific release
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molayab/swift-agent-manager/main/quickinstall.sh | bash -s -- --version 1.0.5 --global

# Custom repo directory
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molayab/swift-agent-manager/main/quickinstall.sh | bash -s -- --dir ~/my-agents
```

The script creates `~/.config/agent-manager/src/` with `skills/`, `commands/`, a `.gitignore`, and an initial git commit. Point it at your own remote when ready:

```sh
cd ~/.config/agent-manager/src
git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/my-agents.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B — clone and install

Clone your fork (or this repo), then choose how to build or download:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<you>/agent-manager ~/agent-manager
cd ~/agent-manager
```

**Download a pre-compiled binary** (no Swift toolchain required):

```sh
bash install.sh --binary            # install to ./bin/
bash install.sh --binary --global   # install to /usr/local/bin
bash install.sh --binary --version 1.0.4 --global
```

**Build from source** (requires Swift 6.2):

```sh
bash install.sh            # install to ./bin/
bash install.sh --global   # install to /usr/local/bin
```

Examples throughout this README assume a global install. If you installed locally, replace `agent-manager` with `./bin/agent-manager`.

### How the binary locates the repo

After a successful install, `install.sh` writes the repo path to `~/.config/agent-manager/repo`. The binary reads this file at runtime so it always knows where `skills/` and `commands/` live, regardless of your working directory.

Resolution order:

1. `AGENT_MANAGER_REPO` environment variable — useful in CI or when managing multiple repos
2. `~/.config/agent-manager/repo` — written automatically by `install.sh`
3. Walk up from the current directory looking for `Package.swift` — fallback for `swift run` / development

If you ever move the repo, re-run `install.sh` to update the config file, or set `AGENT_MANAGER_REPO` to the new path:

```sh
export AGENT_MANAGER_REPO=~/new-location/agent-manager
```

---

## Quick Start

```sh
# Symlink all skills into every detected agent
agent-manager skill activate

# Symlink all slash commands into every detected agent
agent-manager command activate
```

Both commands detect which agents are installed on your machine and only target those. Use flags to narrow scope:

```sh
agent-manager skill activate -a opencode        # one agent
agent-manager skill activate -s swiftui-pro     # one skill
agent-manager skill activate --dry-run          # preview without making changes
```

---

## Repository Layout

```
skills/      ← skill context files, one directory per skill
commands/    ← slash command markdown files
Sources/     ← Swift CLI source (the agent-manager binary)
```

---

## Adding Skills and Commands

Scaffold a new file, edit it, then activate:

```sh
agent-manager skill new "my-skill"     # creates skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
agent-manager command new "deploy"     # creates commands/deploy.md
```

After editing the generated file:

```sh
agent-manager skill activate -s my-skill
agent-manager command activate -c deploy
```

---

## Installing Skills from GitHub

Any public GitHub repository that follows the `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` layout works as a source:

```sh
# Interactive picker — browse the full remote catalogue
agent-manager skill install rudrankriyam/app-store-connect-cli-skills

# Install a specific skill by name
agent-manager skill install rudrankriyam/app-store-connect-cli-skills asc-build-lifecycle

# Overwrite a skill that already exists locally
agent-manager skill install rudrankriyam/app-store-connect-cli-skills asc-build-lifecycle --force

# Activate after installing
agent-manager skill activate
```

> **Rate limits** — unauthenticated GitHub API requests are limited to 60/hour. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your environment to raise this limit:
>
> ```sh
> export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_…
> agent-manager skill install rudrankriyam/app-store-connect-cli-skills
> ```

---

## Importing Commands from Agents

Copy `.md` command files from agent directories on your machine into the repo's `commands/` folder, so they can be versioned and activated across all agents:

```sh
agent-manager command import              # interactive picker
agent-manager command import -a opencode  # specific agent only
agent-manager command import --force      # overwrite existing files
```

Only markdown-format agents are supported (OpenCode, Claude Code, Windsurf). TOML-based agents such as Gemini CLI are skipped.

---

## Public, Private, or Mixed

### Fully public repo

Commit everything. Your skills and commands are openly shareable. Others can install them with `skill install`.

### Fully private repo

Keep the repository private on GitHub. Nothing is shared. All tooling works identically.

### Mixed — public repo with private files

The most common setup. The repo is public, but individual skills or commands that are personal or work-specific are marked private. They are git-ignored and never leave your machine; everything else is shared.

Use the `.private` naming convention:

| Item | On disk | Symlinked as |
|---|---|---|
| Private skill | `skills/my-skill.private/` | `<agent>/skills/my-skill` |
| Private command | `commands/my-cmd.private.md` | `<agent>/commands/my-cmd.md` |

The `skill private` and `command private` subcommands toggle a file between private and public — renaming it and repairing any active symlinks automatically:

```sh
# Make a skill private (git-ignored)
agent-manager skill private swiftui-pro
# skills/swiftui-pro/ → skills/swiftui-pro.private/

# Make a command private (git-ignored)
agent-manager command private commit
# commands/commit.md → commands/commit.private.md

# Toggle back to public
agent-manager skill private swiftui-pro
```

You can also create private files directly using the `.private` naming convention — no toggle step required.

## Syncing Across Machines

```sh
agent-manager push -m "add deploy command"   # stage all changes, commit, and push
agent-manager pull                           # pull latest on another machine
agent-manager clean                          # remove dead symlinks
```

`clean` is useful after deleting, renaming, or moving skills and commands. It scans every known agent directory and removes any symlink whose target no longer exists:

```sh
agent-manager clean           # remove dead symlinks
agent-manager clean --dry-run # preview without removing
```

## Skill Format

`SKILL.md` requires YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when the agent should use it.
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the agent…
```

---

## Command Format

`commands/name.md` uses a `description` frontmatter field and `$ARGUMENTS` as a placeholder for whatever the user types after the slash command:

```markdown
---
description: Review the given file or diff for issues.
---

Review the following for correctness, style, and potential bugs:

$ARGUMENTS
```
